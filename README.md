# THIS SERVICE HAS BEEN DEPRECATED IN FAVOUR OF THE [EXTRACT](https://github.com/CybercentreCanada/assemblyline-service-extract/) SERVICE

# Autoit Ripper service
This repository is a maintained version of [a self-developed Assemblyline service](https://github.com/NVISOsecurity/assemblyline-service-autoit-ripper) based on the tool created by [Nazywan](https://github.com/nazywam/AutoIt-Ripper).

It was created by [x1mus](https://github.com/x1mus) with support from [Sorakurai](https://github.com/Sorakurai), [RenaudFrere](https://github.com/RenaudFrere), and [jvanwilder](https://github.com/jvanwilder) at [NVISO](https://github.com/NVISOsecurity).

It supports compiled executables via the `autoit-ripper` PyPI package, as well as compiled scripts via the UnAutoIt project that [was bundled into CAPE sandbox at one point in time](https://github.com/kevoreilly/CAPEv2/blob/892afc9a9031286d99b70965f1bfd1a9ee009ed8/changelog.md?plain=1#L429).
